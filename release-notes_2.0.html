          PLUS version 2.0 has been released! Please take a moment to read about
          the latest features that are now available in the app (<a

          Your home page has been redesigned for better readability.
          Specifically, the list of students has changed to allow you to view
          more categories and students without scrolling, and the Resources
          button has been moved into the navigation bar at the top. For Admins,
          the Admin Page button has also moved to the header.

        <div>
          This release introduces the Resource Assistant. It can be launched
          from the 'Resources' tab (previously a list on the left side of the
          screen) on a student's dashboard.
        </div>
        <div class="release-note-img">
          <img src="images/release_notes/resource_assistant_btn.png" />
        </div>

        <div>
          With the Resource Assistant, you can choose to answer one or more
          questions about your student, the answers of which are used to guide
          you to a resource that you can use to help the student.
        </div>
        <div class="release-note-img">

        </div>

        <div class="bottom-pad">
          In this example, the Resource Assistant has suggested the resources in
          the "Supporting engagement" category might be useful for helping
          Alyssa become more engaged in learning math. You can choose to explore
          those resources or answer additional questions and see if other
          resources are recommended that might be useful for your work with
          Alyssa.
        </div>

        <div>
          We have organized our list of resources to make it easier to locate a
          desired resource. You can also toggle between different strategies
          (e.g., Building Relationships) by clicking the dropdown list.
        </div>
        <div class="release-note-img">
          <img src="images/release_notes/resource_list.png" />
        </div>

        <div>
          When assigning resources to students, you will now see a dropdown list
          of all the students, with the current student marked. The latter does
          not apply if you access the resources through the link at the top of
          the page.
        </div>
        <div class="release-note-img">
          <img src="images/release_notes/assign_resource.png" />
        </div>

        <div>
          We have removed the notion of sessions from the app. Reflections can
          be used to make notes of your interactions with the students but can
          be done at any time and are not tied to a particular meeting with your
          student. The Reflections tab on the student dashboard provides a list
          of all previous reflections; the list of reflections can also be
          exported.
        </div>
        <div class="release-note-img">
          <img src="images/release_notes/imageLikeEmbed.png" />
        </div>

        <div>
          A reflection can include general notes and a next objective as well as
          the questions previously included with the start and end session
          notes.
        </div>

        <div class="sub-header">Admins</div>

        <div>
          You can now better manage your students and mentors from the Admin
          dashboard. You can add new students and mentors.
        </div>
        <div class="release-note-img">
          <img src="images/release_notes/admin_page.png" />
        </div>

        <div>
          When adding students you can specify their mentor, as well as the
          EdTech that they will be using. With the app you can add a single
          student or multiple students by uploading a list of first and last
          names.
        </div>
        <div class="release-note-img">
          <img src="images/release_notes/add_student.png" />
        </div>

        <div>
          Clicking on a student's name in the Admin dashboard will open a dialog
          that can be used to edit the student's profile, changing their mentor
          or EdTech, or even remove them from your roster.
        </div>
        <div class="release-note-img">
          <img src="images/release_notes/update_stu_profile.png" />
        </div>

        <div>
          When editing or creating a resource, you can decide automatically
          whether or not to share it with the mentors. You will be asked "Who
          can use this resource?", for which you can answer "only me" or "my
          whole school". Mentors cannot share resources themselves (you would
          have to share it across mentors), so the question does not appear for
          them.
        </div>
        <div class="release-note-img">

        </div>

        <div class="bottom-pad">
          The mentor data, in the app and when exported, now includes "time
          online" for each mentor. The time online is measured in minutes spent
          engaged with the app over the last seven days.
